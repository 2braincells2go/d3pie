Work in progress. Come back soon.

### About

d3pie is a simple, highly configurable script built on d3.js and jQuery for creating simple, attractive pie charts.
It's free, open source, and the source code for the website and script are found right here on github.

Go to d3pie.org to learn about the script, and create your own pie charts via the online generation tool. This section is
to document the codebase only.

### Download

To download the script, go to the [./d3pie](d3pie) folder and pick one of the files (minimized or not).

### The code

If you fancy hacking on the d3pie code, awesome! Visit the [./d3pie-source](d3pie-source) folder. That contains some
